# ElxrBB - A Phoenix Forum Application

## About This Project

This is a learning project to build a forum application using Elixir and Phoenix, documented through a comprehensive tutorial. The goal is to create a modern, real-time forum with features like user authentication, threaded discussions, voting, and more.

## Project Restart (October 2025)

This project was restarted with a clean slate to align the codebase with modern Phoenix patterns and the tutorial lessons. The original development work (2023) is preserved in the `archive/initial-attempt` branch.

### Why the Restart?

The original project had several issues:
- Tutorial lessons didn't match the actual implementation
- Outdated Phoenix patterns and syntax
- Missing core forum functionality
- Inconsistent code structure

This fresh start allows us to:
- Follow the tutorial lessons step-by-step
- Use modern Phoenix patterns (LiveView, HEEx, etc.)
- Validate each lesson as we build
- Maintain clean, consistent code

## Current Status

- **Lesson 1**: Environment Setup - Not started
- **Lesson 2**: User Authentication - Not started  
- **Lesson 3**: Forum Functionality - Not started
- **Lessons 4+**: Advanced Features - Planned
